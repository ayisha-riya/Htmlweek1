         Invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, HTML was initially a simple tool for
         scientists at CERN to share research documents across different computers.<br>
         Its initial purpose was functional and academic, focusing on creating a 
         system that could link one document to another. <br> 
         This simple, revolutionary idea gave rise to the World Wide Web,<br> 
         transforming disparate documents into a connected network of information. 
         Over the decades, HTML has undergone a continuous evolution, <br> 
         moving from basic text and links to a powerful standard capable of supporting 
         rich multimedia, complex applications, and interactive user experiences.
